# Artistic Views Project

This project is meant to be a website to help no professional artists to promote their work and find alternatives spaces to show it. This alternatives are restaurants or cafes so, at the same time, it pretends to offer to these businesses an adding value for their clients.

This project is only for educational purposes although it would be nice to inspire some social initiative.

## Motivation

A couple of years ago I took draw lessons and we did some exhibitions in our educational center, but I missed the oportunity to show our work in different environments. Besides local galleries, there are not many options (it's hard enough for professionals already). Thinking about it, I came up with this idea to practice and improve my React skills.
